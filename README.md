# Heroes-Of-Torn-Client
Client for a  multiplayer Collectable Turn Based Strategy game built in Unity3D

Players would purchase collections of characters, which they would build a party out of before engaging in turnbased combat with other players online.

An environmental effect system was created, meaning the terrain could be set ablaze upon contact with a firespell. The fire would then propogate acrtoss the terrain using cellular automata.
Other spells, such as water based spells would douse the fire, however this would result in the presence of a temporary cloud of steam, which whilst providing cover, may burn.
